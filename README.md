## MED-CNN
# Overview
 Med-CNN is a convolutional neural network-based method designed for estimating the mediation effects
within high-dimensional biological data. This deep learning approach integrates multiple networks into a
one-dimensional latent mediator while effectively considering the interactive effect among the biological features
within the network.
